;; PEA Server.
;;
;; Written by Akce 2020.
;;
;; Server design notes:
;;  * Navigates via root playlist.
;;  * Playlists are hierarchical.
;;  * Media formats are handled via format specific drivers:
;;    - libmpv for audio (and video on desktop)
;;    - omxplayer for video on rpi
;;    - uade123 for amiga mod files
;;  * State changes are "broadcast" via UDP multicast and include:
;;    - track change (including all tag info)
;;    - current directory / playlist change
;;    - play state change
;;    - current timestamp
;;  * One control unicast TCP socket accepts client connections to:
;;    - query server on current state and accept response
;;    - query playlists
;;    - change server state and accept response
;;    ? client connections to be short lived. ie, command / response / close.
